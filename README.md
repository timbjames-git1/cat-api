# Felines

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It makes use of Bootstrap 4 for responsive grid layout, and some inspiration from this Bootstrap 4 template https://preview.colorlib.com/#photosen

## Running the project

The project has been deployed via GitHub Pages and can be accessed at https://timbjames-git1.github.io/cat-api/

Alternatively you can clone the repository, then in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

I have added some basic tests just to see what can be done. Open a command window within the folder, then run the command.
